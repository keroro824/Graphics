Extra Credit:
We do the the Multiple spheres.
It is based on If in the command line we have "-multis x y r", (x,y and r are float), a sphere with location (x, y) and radius r will be displayed. 

To draw multiple spheres, first use -multis flag for every single sphere you want to add in, then followed by x, y and r which specify each sphere's x-coordinate, y-coordinate and radius respectively. e.g."-multis 100 100 100 -multis -100 -100 100" will add two spheres both having radius 100 in the window. To have a reasonable upper limit, no more than 100 spheres can be added onto the graph.
